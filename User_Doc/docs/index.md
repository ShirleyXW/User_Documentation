| **Symptoms** | **Probable Cause** | **Action** |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Unable to load the localhost page | Your URL does not match your port number. | Double check what port you have set in `server.js` and if your browser URL is `localhost:PORT` with `PORT` being the number you have set. |
|     | You forgot to tell the Express app to listen to a port number. | Make sure you have `app.listen(port, () => {})` in  `server.js` to configure which port you want Express to watch.|
|     | You have another app running on the same port. | Close any additional servers that might be running. Only one app per port is possible. |
|ESLint warns you about the use of the console| You have not configured ESLint to accept `console.log`. | Make sure you have `rules: {'no-console': 'off' },` set in `.eslintrc.js` as directed in [Eslint Customization](/pages/configuration/#customization)|
