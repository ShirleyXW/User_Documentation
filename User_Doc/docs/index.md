## Slack User Documentation

Welcome!ðŸ‘‹ Let's create a new workspace for you and your team with awesome features. This documentation will guide you through setting up a new workplace in Slack, planning projects using Canvas, and integrating Zoom into your workplace. These steps keep you updated and better communicate with your teammates.

> **[Canvas](https://slack.com/help/articles/203950418-Use-a-canvas-in-Slack)** is a built-in surface in Slack that supports fully formatted content that won't fit in a simple message.
